    Hosted at the Isotope11 office, the monthly meeting (usually on the last Wednesday of each month) offers Birmingham area Ruby professionals and enthusiasts a chance to catch up with other like-minded individuals and also expand your skill set. Don't worry though, you don't need to be a Ruby master to be able to learn a little and get more familiarized with the language.
