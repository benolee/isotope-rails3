    When we're not constantly churning out work, we like to pick up and try out new development technologies and further hone our skills and also give back t the great Ruby community by hosting monthly meetings (we have pizza too!). The meetings give many of us here a chance to further research interesting topics and present to and discuss with other Ruby enthusiasts.
