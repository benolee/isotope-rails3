            =# image_tag 'feature_mlm.png'
          %p Where do you start? Just as an architect creates a blueprint before building a house, we do the same for your software project. Before coding ever begins, we create a realistic specification to guide your technological development. Through a series of short, intense sessions we build user stories and mockups for your entire application. This keeps development costs down, and encourages the entire development process to remain agile.
